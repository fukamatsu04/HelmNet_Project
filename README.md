# SafeGuard Corp – Helmet Detection System

## 📘 Business Context

Workplace safety is a critical concern in hazardous environments such as construction sites, manufacturing plants, and industrial zones. A fundamental safety measure is the use of protective helmets, which reduce the risk of severe head injuries caused by falling objects or operational machinery. However, enforcing helmet compliance manually across large workforces and dynamic settings is often inefficient and error-prone.

To address these challenges, SafeGuard Corp initiated the development of an AI-powered image classification system capable of automatically detecting whether workers are wearing helmets in surveillance images. The aim is to enhance compliance monitoring, reduce risks, and ensure a safer working environment through automation, scalability, and improved accuracy.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build a robust image classification model that categorizes input images into two classes:

- **With Helmet**: Images where workers are properly wearing safety helmets.
- **Without Helmet**: Images where workers are not wearing helmets.

This model will serve as the core of the automated monitoring system, supporting safety teams in identifying non-compliance in real-time.

## 🗂️ Data Description

The dataset provided for this project consists of **631 labeled images**, divided into two categories:

- **With Helmet**: 311 images
- **Without Helmet**: 320 images

### Dataset Characteristics

- **Variability in Conditions**: The dataset includes images from various real-world environments such as construction sites, factories, and warehouses, incorporating differences in lighting, background clutter, angles, and distances.
- **Diverse Worker Activities**: Subjects are captured in multiple scenarios—standing, walking, bending, or using tools—reflecting a wide range of natural workplace actions.

These variations ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen scenarios and enhances its practical value for deployment in diverse industrial settings.
